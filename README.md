## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username-here/project-name-here.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory** and open it with editor of your choice or use GUI to do the same.

    ```bash
    cd project-name-here
    code .
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**. You may use integrated terminal if you text editor is equipped with it (for VSCode press CTRL+`) or use terminal used previously to clone the repository.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev typescript
    npm install --save-dev sass
    ```

## Usage

There are few ways to launch and use project's current dev build. You may use one depending on your needs and preferences.

### Using VSCode and Live Server (preferred)

1. **Open the project in VSCode**: If you haven't done that already to install dependencies open the project either by opening VSCode and choosing a folder under `File > Open Folder`, using option `Open with Code` in context menu by right clicking folder with the project, or typing `code .` while being in the project directory in terminal of your choice.

2. **Generate JS files**: In terminal of your choice run `npm run tsc`. This should run TypeScript Compiler that will generate your JS files in src/js/ directory. You should not edit them, only modify TS files and save them, TSC launched in the terminal will do the rest.

3. **Generate CSS files**: As of now the project has no Sass files, so no further action is needed for now, but will be needed in future renditions of this project.

4. **Install the Live Server Extenstion**: Navigate to Extensions tab on the sidebar on the left, or by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+X and search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey. Install the extension and reload the app by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+P, typing `reload` and the pressing enter.

5. **Launch the project**: Either right-click on the HTML file in public/ and select "Open with Live Server", or search for "Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the program.

6. **Interact with the project**: Web project should now launch in your default browser. For the time being the main index file is in public/ directory. Navigate there in your browser and you should be good to go.

### Using a Typescript Bundler
