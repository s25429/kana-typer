## Overview
This web application works very similair to ones like [typefast.io](https://typefast.io/), but in this case it's specifically for Japanse characters. \
Random kana characters are generated and the user is supposed to type them correctly as fast as possible. At the end statistics are generated, like number of characters per minute.

## Usage

There are few ways to launch and use project's current dev build. You may use one depending on your needs and preferences.

### Using VSCode and Live Server (preferred)

    3. Command in terminal while being in project's directory
        ```bash
        code .
        ```
    
2. **Generate JS files using TypeScript Compiler**: 
    1. If you have installed "typescript" module simply run
        ```bash
        npm run tsc
        ```
    2. Additional configuration for TypeScript is located in `tsconfig.json`.

3. **Generate CSS files using VSCode Extension**:
