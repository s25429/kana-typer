## Overview
This web application works very similair to ones like [typefast.io](https://typefast.io/), but in this case it's specifically for Japanse characters. \
Random kana characters are generated and the user is supposed to type them correctly as fast as possible. At the end statistics are generated, like number of characters per minute.

## Usage

There are few ways to launch and use project's current dev build. You may use one depending on your needs and preferences.

### Using VSCode and Live Server (preferred)

1. **Open the project in VSCode**: You can do it in a few ways.
    1. Open folder option in VSCode \
        ![vscode-open-folder](./imgs/vscode-open-folder.jpg)

    2. Use context menu by right-clicking on project folder \
        ![vscode-open-with-code](./imgs/vscode-open-with-code.jpg)

    3. Command in terminal while being in project's directory
        ```bash
        code .
        ```
    
2. **Generate JS files using TypeScript Compiler**: 
    1. If you have installed "typescript" module simply run
        ```bash
        npm run tsc
        ```
    2. Additional configuration for TypeScript is located in `tsconfig.json`.

3. **Generate CSS files using VSCode Extension**: 
    1. Download "Live Sass Compiler" extension by Glenn Marks. \
        ![vscode-extension-sass](./imgs/vscode-extension-sass.jpg)
    2. Launch Sass by clicking ![vscode-launch-sass](./imgs/vscode-launch-sass.jpg) button on the bottom right of VSCode.
    3. Additional configuration for this extension is located in `.vscode/settings.json`.

    ![select-public-folder](./imgs/select-public-folder.jpg)

6. **Interact with the project**: \
    As you make changes to the project's code, new JS and CSS files will be generated and page will refresh if you have section 2, 3 and 4 running in the background.
